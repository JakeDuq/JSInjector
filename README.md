### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
Then in the HelloWorldApplicationCustomizer.ts file change the <FULL URL TO JAVASCRIPT FILE> part to the full url that points to the JavaScript file. For example :- https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/test/Scripts/JavaScriptExample.js
Once this is done run gulp bundle --ship, the gulp package-solution --ship.
Upload the sppkg file to the app catalog, then add the extension to the relevant site.
```
